# 8-queens-puzzle
graphic Java implementation of the famous 8 Queens Chess puzzle 

## Description
This Java application solves the 8 Queens Puzzle, a classic problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. The project provides an interactive GUI for the puzzle.

## Libraries and Frameworks

- **Java:** The core programming language used for the application.
- **javax.swing:** Provides components and functionality for creating the GUI.
- **java.awt:** Provides basic GUI components and graphics functionality.
- **java.io:** Used for file input/output operations.
- **java.util:** Used for various utility classes and data structures.

## Features
- Interactive GUI for placing queens on the chessboard.
- Visual indication of the queens' positions.
- Check solution button to verify if the placement is correct.
- Hall of Fame to display the names of players who have solved the puzzle.
- Dark mode and light mode toggle for a personalized experience.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **GUI Development:** Developing a responsive and intuitive GUI was challenging, but the Swing library provided the necessary tools for creating the interface.
- **Algorithm Implementation:** Implementing the algorithm to check the puzzle solution required careful consideration of queen placement rules, which was achieved through thorough testing and debugging of the algorithm.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the user interface with more visual feedback and animations.
- Implement more advanced algorithms for solving the puzzle efficiently.
- allow different number of queens and different board sizes
